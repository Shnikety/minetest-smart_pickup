# minetest-smart_pickup

Lets players choose weather to add item-drops from nodes to there inventory or drop them in the game.

Currently in development:
a blacklist of items to be ignored & not picked up along with chat commands
and a menu to edit the list.

Makes mineing and harvesting far more pleasant, even if editing the list of items to be ignored is painfull right now.


Based on [variouse versions](https://forum.minetest.net/search.php?keywords=item+drop&terms=all&author=&fid%5B%5D=46&sc=1&sf=titleonly&sr=topics&sk=t&sd=d&st=0&ch=300&t=0&submit=Search)
of [item_drop] mod for MineTest with refinements and new features. See also [PilzAdam's original](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=2656).

## Licence:
LGPLv2.1/CC BY-SA 3.0. Particle code from WCILA mod by Aurailus, originally licensed MIT.

some code borrowed from other mods, see comments in init.lua for details

## Settings:
* Player settings may be configured from within the game itself.
  (Settings tab > Advanced settings > Mods > item_drop)
* `pickup_mode`: There are three unique modes to choose from...
  * Auto: items within `magnet_radius` automaticly zoom towards player and are picked up when within `pickup_radius`.
  * KeyPress: same as Auto but the player has to press a key otherwise items are ignored.
  * Both: use key to pull items towards you, items within `pickup_radius` are automatic.
* `keytype`: What key to use to pickup items.
* `keyinvert`: Collect items when the key is not pressed instead of when it is pressed.
* `pickup_sound_gain`: There is a sound when picking up items. This controls the volume.
* `pickup_particle`: Displays a particle of the item picked up above the player if `true`.
* `pickup_radius`: The maximum distance (in nodes) from which items are collected.
* `magnet_radius`: Items within this range will fly to the player.

## Chat Commands:
(Please note that these are very primitive, and annoying to use, right now.  Expect these to change.)

* `item_ignore [item]`: will cause the player to ignore and not pick up valid items.
* `item_pickup [item]`: lets various modes auto pick-up the item.
This is default behavior so this just undoes the 'item_ignore' command.
* `item_list`: prints out the list of items that are not to be picked up.
* `item_clear`: clears all entries in the blacklist of items.
